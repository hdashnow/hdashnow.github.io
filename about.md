## Biography

Harriet Dashnow is a bioinformatics postdoc in the [Quinlan Lab](http://quinlanlab.org/) at the University of Utah. She did her PhD research in the [Oshlack Lab](http://oshlacklab.com/) at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) and the University of Melbourne. She is best known for her work in detecting STR expansions, but has also published bioinformatic methods for clinical exome sequencing and microbial gene detection. She has previously worked as a bioinformatician at the University of Melbourne and [Melbourne Bioinformatics](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/), where she worked on the [Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance](https://www.melbournegenomics.org.au/) project.

Harriet obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Psychology), a Bachelor of Science (Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) and a Master of Science (Bioinformatics) with Dean’s Honours from the University of Melbourne. She was awarded an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship, a Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Top Up Scholarship and a Australian Genomics Health Alliance PhD Award for her PhD studies.

Harriet is committed to supporting the bioinformatics community. She has served as Vice President and then President of [COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/) (the International Society for Computational Biology Regional Student Group for Australia) and has served as the student representative on the [Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society](https://www.abacbs.org/) executive committee.

She has substantial experience in teaching bioinformatics and genetics at both the undergraduate and graduate level. She organises and teaches computational skills workshops in such areas as genomics, Software and Data Carpentry, Python, R, Unix and Git version control. She co-authored the O’Reilly programming book [Elegant SciPy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do).
