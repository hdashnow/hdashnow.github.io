## Biography

Harriet Dashnow is a bioinformatician and PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI). She has previously worked as a bioinformatician in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Melbourne and the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI), where she worked on the Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance project.

Harriet obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Psychology), a Bachelor of Science (Genetics and Biochemistry) and a Master of Science (Bioinformatics) with Dean’s Honours from the University of Melbourne. She was awarded an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) and MCRI PhD Top Up scholarship for her PhD studies.

Harriet is committed to supporting the bioinformatics community. She has served as Vice President and then President of COMBINE (the International Society for Computational Biology Regional Student Group for Australia) and has been elected as the student representative on the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society executive committee.

She has substantial experience in teaching bioinformatics and genetics at both the undergraduate and graduate level. She organises and teaches computational skills workshops in such areas as genomics, Software and Data Carpentry, Python, R, Unix and Git version control. She recently co-authored the O’Reilly programming book [Elegant SciPy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do).
